# node_blog_template_build_edu

I built an app that demonstrates user registration, login, and members only area. The views conditionally display navigation menus dependant on status of user.  Client recieve feedback messages on success / failure of registration or login or logout.  Passport is used for localstrategy.  Bcryptjs is used for hashing passwords.  Jade is used for templating views.  MongoDB is used with Mongoose. Bootstrap 3 is used for quick and simple design

### Perptual Learning
I learn best by working on real projects. Doing this I not only work through the logic of the build, I see the process of building. It is not something then that I've just read, or thought about doing. I've built this app. The ideas and steps for these builds are not my own. Following along, I write every line of code; bugs are found, researched, and fixed. This project was demonstrated in the course Learn_NodeJS_by_Building_10_projects on StackSkills from StackCommerce.
